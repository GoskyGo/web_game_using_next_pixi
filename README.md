# ISO Prototype

You can configure important settings within `src/config.ts`.

# Installing dependencies

Before building or running the project locally you have to execute `npm install` in the terminal.

## Running the preview

You can run a preview by running the `npm run dev` command. This will spin up a dev server and display the URL in the terminal under which it's reachable. 

## Building the project

You can build the project by running the `npm run build` command. This will create a "dist" directory with the production files. Note that the generated `index.html` has to be accessed from a webserver and will not work if run locally.
